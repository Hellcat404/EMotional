# EMotional - Online emotion tracker

EMotional is a website which allows users to - at any time - log in and submit how they are currently feeling.
This data will be stored in a database and will be viewable by the user to see how their day/month/year looked on an emotional level.

##TODO

- ~~Make a rough site with authentication (Through Discord) that allows the user to just submit one of 5 emotions (Very sad, Sad, Neutral, Happy, Very Happy)~~

- Allow user to enter a comment along with their selection of emotion to further substatiate their selection (Prefer some form of encryption for storage - prefer only user can decrypt message)

- Allow user to view emotional data across a timeline (calendar / simple timeline) - Show amount of submissions per day (Think github commits tracker)
